## Geocomputation and Earth Observation (GECO)

We are a collection of researchers driven by our curiosity to understand how the terrestrial biosphere operates. We work at the intersection of Earth system science, ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, ecology, applied statistics, machine learning, and high-performance computing. With our research we contribute to a better understanding of issues that are becoming increasingly pressing to society and policy and that are key to creating a sustainable future.

We are committed to an Open Science practice. We‚Äôre building an environment of open source tools for ecosystem data and modelling. This should empower the community to use latest methodological innovations, developed by our group. Here is a list of our products.
